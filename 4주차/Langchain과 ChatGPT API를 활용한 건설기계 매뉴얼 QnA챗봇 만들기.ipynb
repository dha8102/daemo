DX255LC-7 Safety1-18Proper Work Tools and AttachmentsOnly use work tools and attachments that are recommended byDOOSAN for use on DOOSAN machines. When installing andusing optional attachments, read instruction manual forattachment, and general information related to attachments in thismanual. Because DOOSAN cannot anti cipate, identify or test allattachments that owners may want  to install on their machines,contact DOOSAN for writt en authorization and approval ofattachments, and their compat ibility with optional kits.Attachments and attachment control systems that arecompatible with the machine are required for safe and reliablemachine operation. Do not exceed maximum operating weight(machine weight plus attachment) that is listed on ROPScertification plate.Make sure that all guards and shields are in place on machineand on work tool. Depending on type or combination of workequipment, there is a potential that work equipment couldinterfere with the cabin or other parts of machine. Before usingunfamiliar work equipment, check if there is any potential ofinterference, and operate with caution.While you are performing any maintenance, testing, oradjustments to attachments, stay clear of the following areas:cutting edges, pinch points , and crushing surfaces.Never use attachment as a work platform or manlift.Contact your DOOSAN distributo r about auxiliary  hydraulic kitsfor attachments installation. If you are in doubt aboutcompatibility of a particular attach ment with a machine, consultyour DOOSAN  distributor.Pressurized FluidsPressurized air or fluids can cause debris and/or fluids to beblown out. This could result in death or serious injury.Immediately after operations are stopped, coolant, engine oil,and hydraulic oil are at their highest temperatures and theradiator and hydraulic tank are still under pressure. Always waitfor temperature to cool down. Follow specified procedures whenattempting to remove caps, drain oil or coolant, or replacingfilters. Always wait for temperature to cool down, and followspecified procedures when performing these operations. Failureto do so can result in death or serious injury.When pressurized air and/or pressurized water is used forcleaning, wear protec tive clothing, protective shoes, and eyeprotection. Eye protection includes  goggles or a protective faceshield.Pressure can be trapped in a hydraulic system and must berelieved before main tenance is started.Releasing trapped pressure can cause sudden machinemovement or attachment movement. Use caution if youdisconnect hydraulic lines or fittings.FG018457Figure 4  Safety1-19DX255LC-7High-pressure oil that is released can cause a hose to whip or oilto spray. Fluid penetration can resu lt in death or serious injury. Iffluid enters skin or eyes, get immediate medical attention from aphysician familiar with this injury.Obey all local laws and regulations for disposal of liquids.To prevent hot coolant from spraying out, stop engine and waitfor coolant to cool. Using gloves, slowly loosen cap to relievepressure.Flying or Falling ObjectsOn work sites where there is a potential hazard that flying orfalling objects can hit operator\\'s cabin, select and use a guard tomatch operating conditions for additional operator protection.Working in mines, tunnels, deep pits, and loose or wet surfaces,could produce hazard of falling rocks or flying objects. Additionalprotection for operator\\'s cabi n could be required such as anOperator Protection Guard (OPG) or window guards. Contactyour DOOSAN distributor for information on available protectiveguards.To prevent personnel from being struck by flying objects, keeppersonnel out of work area.HAOA110LFigure 5 HAOA100LFigure 6  DX255LC-7 Safety1-20Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)Do not wear loose clothing and accessories. Secure long hair.These items can snag on controls or on other parts ofequipment.Do not wear oily clothes.

Do not o perate machine until problem hasbeen corrected.Crushing and CuttingKeep objects away from moving  f a n  b l a d e s .  F a n  b l a d e s  c a nthrow and cut objects.Do not use a wire rope that is kinked or frayed, or a wire ropewith any loss of diameter. Wear leather gloves when handling awire rope.When striking a loose retainer pin, it can fly out and can cause aserious injury. Make sure that area is clear of personnel whenstriking a retainer pin. To avoid injury to your eyes, wear safetygoggles when striking a retainer pin.Do not put your hand, arm or any other part of your bodybetween movable parts. If go ing between movable parts isnecessary, always position and secure work equipment so itcannot move. Properly support equipment before performingany work or maintenance under raised equipment.If control levers are operated , clearance between machine andwork equipment will change a nd this may lead to seriousdamage or can result in death or serious injury. Stay clear ofareas that may have a sudden change in clearance withmachine movement or equipment movement. Stay clear of allrotating and moving parts. Unless instructed, never attemptadjustments while machine is moving or while engine is running.HAOA020LFigure 7  Safety1-21DX255LC-7Do not depend on hydraulic cylinders to support raisedequipment. Equipment can fall if a control is moved, or if ahydraulic line breaks, is loosened or disconnected.If it is necessary to remove guards to perform maintenance,always install guards after maintenance is completed.Hot Coolant and Oils - Burn PreventionDo not touch any part of an op erating engine. Immediately afteroperations are stopped, coolant, engine oil, and hydraulic oil areat their highest temperatures. The radiator and hydraulic tankare still under pressure. Always wait for temperature to cooldown. Attempting to remove caps, drain oil or coolant, orreplacing filters may lead to serious burns, if done when hot.Relieve all pressure in air system, hydraulic oil system,lubrication system, fuel system,  and cooling system, before anylines, fittings or related items are disconnected.To prevent hot oil or coolant from spraying out, stop engine, waitfor oil and coolant to cool. Us ing gloves, slowly loosen cap torelieve pressure.HDO1010LFigure 8 FG019095Figure 9 FG019096Figure 10  DX255LC-7 Safety1-22Fire and Explosion PreventionAll fuels, most lubricants an d some coolant mixtures areflammable and can cause a fire resulting in death or seriousinjury, and property damage.

Keep in mind most systems use a high-pressure fluidor air to raise or lower equipment. The procedure can causehigh-pressure air, or hydraulic pressure, or some other media tobe released to lower the equipment.EX1400133Figure 42  DX255LC-7 Safety1-50Engine StopTurn engine starter switch to \"O\" (OFF) position and removeengine starter switch key.Before lowering any equipment with engine stopped, clear areaaround equipment of all personnel and bystanders. Thisprocedure will cause high -pressure air or hy draulic pressure tobe released to lower equipment.Do not stop engine immediately after the machine has beenoperated under load. This can cause overheating andaccelerated wear of engine components.After the machine is parked, allow engine to run for five minutesbefore stopping the engine.

This acid is verycorrosive and cannot be rinsed or washed off from the skin. Itcauses very severe burns which take a long time to heal.It usually means that damaged tissue must be surgicallyremoved. Several hours may pass after contact with the acid,before any symptoms appear and therefore one is not given anyimmediate warning. The acid may remain on the machine partsfor several years after a fire.If swelling, redness or a sti nging feeling ap pears and onesuspects that cause may be contact with heated rubber thatcontains fluorides, contact a me dical doctor immediately. If amachine, or part of a machine, has been exposed to fire orsevere heat, it must be handl ed by specially trained personnel.In all handling of machines after a fire, thick rubber gloves andprotective goggles must be used.The area around a part which has been very hot and which maybe made of rubber that contains fluorides must bedecontaminated by thorough and ample washing with limewater(a solution or suspension of ca lcium hydroxide, i.e. slaked limein water). After the work has been completed, the gloves mustbe washed in limewater and then discarded. DX255LC-7 Safety1-60Rubber and PlasticsPolymer materials when heated, can form compounds thatcreate a health hazard and can harm the environment.Scrapped rubber and plastics must never be burned. Extraprecautions must be taken when servicing machines that havebeen in a fire or exposed to extreme heat.If gas cutting or welding is to be done near such materials, thefollowing safety instruct ions must be followed:•P r o t e c t  t h e  m a t e r i a l  f r o m  h e a t .•U s e  p r o t e c t i v e  g l o v e s ,  p r o t e c t i v e  g o g g l e s  a n d  a n  a p p r o v e drespirator.Waste Hazardous to the EnvironmentPainted parts or parts made of plastic or rubber which are to bescrapped must never be burned, but must be taken care of by anapproved refuse handling plant.Batteries, plastic objects and anything else which is suspectedof being dangerous to the environment must be taken care of inan environmentally safe way.Check List After FireWhen handling a machine which has been damaged by fireor been exposed to intense heat, the following protectivemeasures must under all circumstances be followed:Use thick, gloves made of rubber and wear goggles which arecertain to protect your eyes.Never touch burned components with your bare hands, as thereis a risk that you may come into contact with melted polymermaterials. First wash thoroughl y with plenty of limewater (asolution or suspension of calciu m hydroxide, i.e. slaked lime inwater).As a precaution, seals (O-rings and other oil seals) shouldalways be handled as if they were  made of rubber that containsfluorides.Treat skin, which is suspected of having touched burned rubberthat contains fluorides, with Hy drofluoric Acid Burn Jelly orsomething similar. Seek me dical advice. Symptom may notappear until several hours afterwards.Discard gloves, rags etc. which are suspected of having touchedburned rubber that contains fluorides.

Coolant overheatedIf the engine co olant overheats, this warnin g symbol illuminates, an alarm sounds, and the engine speeddecreases automatically until the coolant temperature drops again.Do not turn off the engine at this time. Turning off the engine further overheats the coolant, which may lead toengine knocking due to a surge resulting from overheating.NOTE: Check the engine coolant temperature gauge. If  t h e  g a u g e  p o i n t e r  i s  i n  t h e  r e d  r a n g e ,  i tmeans that the coolant is overheated. Henc e, the coolant temperature warning lampilluminates and the engine speed decreases automatically.In such cases, the engine must be idled until the gauge pointer returns to the normal whiterange. Once the pointer returns to the white ra nge, do not turn off t he engine immediately; idlethe engine for another 3 ~ 5 minutes. Failing to do so may cause a surge resulting fromoverheating, thereby damaging the engine. Id ling the engine releases heat slowly andreduces the temperature gradually. Once all necessary measures have been taken, check the coolant level once again, as well aswhether the fan belt is loose and whether there is any foreign ma tter on the radiator.
